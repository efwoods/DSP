1. First, perform a join of the data sheets shown on the left in the Data Source window within Tableau. Joins work similarly as in the Tableau Prep by dragging and dropping the sheets into the main view. What is the data attribute that Tableau used to perform this join? "Dispensed Pharmacy"
2. Do exploratory data analysis to answer the following questions:
   1. What is the average prescription price over time? The average ranges from 3.4523 to 3.5607 from the years 2007 to 2010.
   2. What is the correlation between prescription quantity vs. profit? There is an inversely proportional relationship between prescription quantity and profit.
   3. How does profit vary by state? The greatest profit is New York & the smallest profit is South Carolina.
   4. What pharmacy and drug supplier had the highest profit across all states? Sylvia Foulston from New Jersey had the highest net profit with $30,562,188.
3. Come up with at least three additional questions and visualizations of your own about this data. Explore some of Tableau’s analytics features, including trend lines, in the “Analytics” pane.
   1. Which pharmacy & state has the highest average prescription price? Cynthia Voltz from Maryland averages at 5.526
   2. The highest net profit drug route is ORAL with $4,841,349,001.
   3. How does prescription quantity change over time? The lowest prescription quantity is 1,354,400,600 in Q2 of 2007. The highest prescription quantity is 1,959,530,900 in Q4 of 2008.
4. Finally, create a Dashboard that answers several questions and give it a meaningful title. Add some interactive filtering to the Dashboard.
