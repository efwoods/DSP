1. First, perform a join of the data sheets shown on the left in the Data Source window within Tableau. Joins work similarly as in the Tableau Prep by dragging and dropping the sheets into the main view. What is the data attribute that Tableau used to perform this join?
2. Do exploratory data analysis to answer the following questions:
   1. What is the average prescription price over time?
   2. What is the correlation between prescription quantity vs. profit?
   3. How does profit vary by state?
   4. What pharmacy and drug supplier had the highest profit across all states?
3. Come up with at least three additional questions and visualizations of your own about this data. Explore some of Tableau’s analytics features, including trend lines, in the “Analytics” pane.
4. Finally, create a Dashboard that answers several questions and give it a meaningful title. Add some interactive filtering to the Dashboard.
