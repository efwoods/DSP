Case Description
The case features the work of LP Maurice (HBS ’08) as he decides to take on the fragmented bus travel industry and launch an online business that aggregates and shares bus schedules for routes around the world. His first challenge: finding that the data he needs is scattered, siloed, and sometimes offline. The case follows him and his team as they take on challenges as the start-up evolves and develops. Topics include acquiring data, web-based prototyping to understand customer preferences, customer acquisition and retention metrics (SEO and SEM), and strategic choices around transforming from a B-to-C organization to a B-to-B enterprise.

Key Questions for Case Reading and Peer Learning Session Discussion. Please review and answer on the following cards.

1. Did anything surprise you about how Busbud developed over several years? 
   Answer: I was surprised that Busbud closed a \$1M seed round in 2013, obtained 30 bus suppliers in a year, then closed a $9M Series A financing round that same year. 

   1. Do you agree with some of their actions such as putting up static rather than dynamic web pages for bus schedules of countries Maurice had visited? 
      1. Having a static web page was a smart choice which allowed their website to appear higher on search results. However, Busbud's site agreed to pay the browser if a user clicked on a Busbud ad the browser served as part of a search query. Because the paid ad is at the top of the search results, it is redundant to use a static vs a dynamic website to achieve higher listings.

   2. Spending a year selling Orleans Express to students using other students rather than developing an online presence?
      1. Spending the time selling Orleans Express allowed the team to focus on creating real partnerships with larger operators. 

2. Why might Maurice and the team have decided not to scrape the web for operators’ schedule data in the early days? Should they have?

   1. What are the benefits and costs of doing this?
       1. When a website is updated, there is a technical debt that has accrued because the codebase requires updates each time a scraped website modifies its structure resulting in downtime. Furthermore, changing of a site's structure would  need to be monitored so as to send an alert when the scrape failed and caused an error. This is an inefficient design, and there are legal implications for web scraping websites without permission. If legal and non-time consuming, it would be worthwhile to get the site up and running with scraped data until a more robust working solution is identified. 

3. Maurice and his team reported 100,000 unique visits to the “Buenos Aires—Mendoza” website in the first month it was up. Do you have any concerns about that data? 
   1. I am concerned with how Maurice is capturing the value of the visits, and how many unique visitors become returning customers.  

4. As Busbud focused on customer acquisition, Maurice had to decide where to invest and which metrics would be most important to him and his team going forward. What metrics would you prioritize and why?
   1. It would be wise to prioritize unique customers & returning customers. A developer would want to make certain there was a consistent flow of traffic to the website along with a returning customer base to ensure that the business was not only growing its customer base, but maintaining customers as well.
