# Notes:
Knee Plot: Identify the optimal value of k for kmeans clustering by looking at the curve of a range of values of k and identifying the inflection point. 

Multidimensional Scaling: Multidimensional Scaling allows for the visualization of points from cosine similarities. 

Davies-Bouldin: 
A metric for evaluating clustering algorithms. The metric evaluates the quality of the clusters themselves rather than points.
