Key Questions for Case Reading and Peer Learning Session Discussion. Please review and answer on the following cards.

(A):

1. What problem is Booth trying to address at Chateau? Is the data Booth is using helpful to address his problem? 
Booth is trying to sell underperforming wines at a discount to customers based on their purchase preferences. The quantity of alcohol purchased by customer during the interval of one year is pertinent information to address this problem. 

2. Is cluster analysis useful to Booth? Why?
   1. Cluster analysis is useful to Booth because it allows Booth to recognize which customers have a preference for which wine and offer them discounts. This will decrease the surplus of underperforming wine and increase the quality of life of customers who enjoy those particular brands of wine. 

3. Should Booth use Euclidean distance or cosine similarity in cluster analysis? Why?
   1. Booth should use Euclidean distance because he is dealing with the quantity of sales. 

4. Is the more complex deal-by-deal cluster analysis helpful to Booth for marketing wines in 2018? How could he use it? 
   1. Yes, the deal-by-deal cluster analysis provides a more detailed insight into the preferences of a customer. Where a customer may be interested in a particular brand of alcohol, that does not necessarily indicate that they have an interest in a deal on that brand due to a possible spurious reason such as income, habit, diet, etc. He can leverage the deal-by-deal cluster analysis to identify customers that are similar with respect to deals and notice other deals that customers who take deals that customers may be interested in based upon silhouette values. 

(B):

1. How does the supervised approach differ from the unsupervised approach? 

2. Why might Booth want to do collaborative filtering? Is it better than clustering?

3. What choices must Booth make when using collaborative filtering? How should he decide?

4. What is the difference between collaborative filtering with cosine similarity of customers from collaborative filtering with cosine similarity of products?

5. How might Booth use the analysis of deal data for decision-making?
